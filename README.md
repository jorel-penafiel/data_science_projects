# Data Science Side Projects

`restaurant_inspections/` contains a Jupyter Notebook and a cleaned dataset to create a neural network in predicting whether a Chicago restaurant will pass or fail its next inspection.

`sales_forecasting/` contains a Jupyter Notebook and the dataset used to analyze the five-year sales volume of a sample store.  A SARIMA model is then used to predict the daily sales volume for the following year.

`visualization_EDA/` contains some scripts for an interactive visualization interface, using bokeh and flask, based on a SQL database with sqlite and SQLAlchemy.  There's also a script to populate said database.
